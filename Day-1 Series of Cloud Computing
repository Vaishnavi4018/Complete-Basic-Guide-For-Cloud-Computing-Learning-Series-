What is cloud computing?

In simple words, cloud computing means you don't need to own the physical hardware. You rent things like storage,server,networking over the internet and you only pay for what you use and since all these resources
sit virtualy in the internet and can be accessed with the use of internet and this way of accesssing resources is called cloud computing.(computing that happens over the internet)

Definition : US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines Computing as:
“ Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a
shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications,
and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
service provider interaction. ”
